Given lists of sorted list of integers, merge them into one large sorted list.  Can you do it better than O(kn log kn) where n is the length of the longest list, and k is the number of lists?

0(kn log kn)

k = # of lists
n = length of longest list

Example: 
k = 8
n = 3

input = lists = [[],
[],
[10, 12],
[],
[3, 3, 13],
[3],
[10],
[0, 7]]
